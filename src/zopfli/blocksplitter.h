Functions to choose good boundaries for block splitting. Deflate allows encoding
the data in multiple blocks, with a separate Huffman tree for each block. The
Huffman tree itself requires some bytes to encode, so by choosing certain
blocks, you can either hurt, or enhance compression. These functions choose good
ones that enhance it.
