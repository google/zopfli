Stores lit/length and dist pairs for LZ77.
Parameter litlens: Contains the literal symbols or length values.
Parameter dists: Contains the distances. A value is 0 to indicate that there is
no dist and the corresponding litlens value is a literal instead of a length.
Parameter size: The size of both the litlens and dists arrays.
The memory can best be managed by using ZopfliInitLZ77Store to initialize it,
ZopfliCleanLZ77Store to destroy it, and ZopfliStoreLitLenDist to append values.

Finds the longest match (length and corresponding distance) for LZ77
compression.
Even when not using "sublen", it can be more efficient to provide an array,
because only then the caching is used.
array: the data
pos: position in the data to find the match for
size: size of the data
limit: limit length to maximum this value (default should be 258). This allows
    finding a shorter dist for that length (= less extra bits). Must be
    in the range [ZOPFLI_MIN_MATCH, ZOPFLI_MAX_MATCH].
sublen: output array of 259 elements, or null. Has, for each length, the
    smallest distance required to reach this length. Only 256 of its 259 values
    are used, the first 3 are ignored (the shortest length is 3. It is purely
    for convenience that the array is made 3 longer).
