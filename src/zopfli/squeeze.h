/*
The squeeze functions do enhanced LZ77 compression by optimal parsing with a
cost model, rather than greedily choosing the longest length or using a single
step of lazy matching like regular implementations.

Since the cost model is based on the Huffman tree that can only be calculated
after the LZ77 data is generated, there is a chicken and egg problem, and
multiple runs are done with updated cost models to converge to a better
solution.

Does the same as ZopfliLZ77Optimal, but optimized for the fixed tree of the
deflate standard.
The fixed tree never gives the best compression. But this gives the best
possible LZ77 encoding possible with the fixed tree.
This does not create or output any fixed tree, only LZ77 data optimized for
using with a fixed tree.
