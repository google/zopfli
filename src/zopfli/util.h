A block structure of huge, non-smart, blocks to divide the input into, to allow
operating on huge files without exceeding memory, such as the 1GB wiki9 corpus.
The whole compression algorithm, including the smarter block splitting, will
be executed independently on each huge block.
Dividing into huge blocks hurts compression, but not much relative to the size.
Set it to 0 to disable master blocks.

For longest match cache. max 256. Uses huge amounts of memory but makes it
faster. Uses this many times three bytes per single byte of the input data.
This is so because longest match finding has to find the exact distance
that belongs to each length for the best lz77 strategy.
Good values: e.g. 5, 8.

limit the max hash chain hits for this hash value. This has an effect only
on files where the hash value is the same very often. On these files, this
gives worse compression (the value should ideally be 32768, which is the
ZOPFLI_WINDOW_SIZE, while zlib uses 4096 even for best level), but makes it
faster on some specific files.
Good value: e.g. 8192.

Enable to remember amount of successive identical bytes in the hash chain for
finding longest match
required for ZOPFLI_HASH_SAME_HASH and ZOPFLI_SHORTCUT_LONG_REPETITIONS
This has no effect on the compression result, and enabling it increases speed.
*/

/*
Switch to a faster hash based on the info from ZOPFLI_HASH_SAME once the
best length so far is long enough. This is way faster for files with lots of
identical bytes, on which the compressor is otherwise too slow. Regular files
are unaffected or maybe a tiny bit slower.
This has no effect on the compression result, only on speed.
